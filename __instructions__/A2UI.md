Create a plan for the following

1. Research A2UI, AG-UI protocols
2. Get familiar with CoPilotKit UI framework
3. Learn how to integrate A2UI, AG-UI protocols with CoPilotKit UI framework with existing UI in the project
4. Make change in server.py and the UI in a non-breaking manner
5. In existing UI, add a tab for the generative UI using A2UI, AG-UI protocols and Coplitkit
6. In the existing server.py, add a new endpoint for the generative UI using A2UI, AG-UI protocols and Coplitkit
7. Add a tab in the existing UI to switch between the existing UI and the generative UI
8. In the generative UI, retain the chat window from existing UI
9. In the generative UI, add a section to the right of the chat window to display the generated UI using A2UI, AG-UI protocols and Coplitkit
10. refer the backend and frontend samples in - https://github.com/google/A2UI/tree/main/samples
11. In the generative UI, implement for three test cases
    a. When searching for cars, show them in a table with columns - Make, Model, Year, Price
    b. when comparing two cars, show them as two cards side by side
    c. when booking a appointment, show a form to book an appointment
12. for the above 3 test cases, ensure that the 2 way bindings: receivng data from server and shoing in the UI and user actions in UI are sent back to the server and processed
